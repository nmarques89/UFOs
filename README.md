# UFOs
## Overview
The purpose of this project was to learn how convert data stored as a JavaScript array or list to a table to organize the information that accounts for "events" change. In order to react when an element is changed, we deploy Javascript functions to loop through the data to build the table and create a customized dashboard. The customizations include filters with event listeners that will record the information when an element has changed and develop an interactive webpage. Filters can be applied in many ways. In this exercise, we reviewed how to display default data in the table, listen for a button click or trigger the table to update based on the user's input with a select criteria. Finally, we use HTML, Bootstrap and CSS to read the Javascript code and create a webpage that is easy to view, includes filters, images, and a synopsis of the topic.

## Results

A fully functional site, complete with filters, can now be found at [Marques UFO Finder](file:///C:/Users/nemar/OneDrive/Desktop/Columbia%20Bootcamp/UFOs/Index.html)

You can filter by one or all of the search criteria shown. For example, if you search by "City", you will see that the table updated to show the reported sightings that was recorded for that specific city.
## Summary
 Drawbacks:

Unfortunately, the page has several drawbacks. They include:

The search field is "case-sensitive". The table will not update if you do not enter exactly how the data is stored and does not allow for partial entries. This is an issue because it does not intuitively tell the user how the information should be entered other than the "default" example shown.

- There is no button to click, wording or action that tells the user that the table will update after you hit "enter".

- The data is limited and outdated since it is not linked to a "live" source.

Recommendations for further development:

- With the following enhancements, it can greatly improve the user's experience.

- Add additional customizations, such as click-buttons, dropdown list, and/or auto-fill that can help "guide" the user and make the page more interactive.

- Add functionality to pull the data from a live source that includes current and archived data not limited to only the United States, but globally.

- Add a "Latest News" section that will highlight an article showing the most recent reported sighting.
